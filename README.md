"require": {

    "TheTempusProject/TempusProjectCore": "*",

},

"autoload": {

    "psr-4": {

        "TempusProjectCore\": "vendor/TheTempusProject/TempusProjectCore"

    }

}
```

If you prefer to handle auto-loading via other means, you can simply clone this repository wherever you need it. Please note, you will need to install and load the [TempusDebugger](https://github.com/thetempusproject/TempusDebugger) library in order to utilize the debug to console options.
